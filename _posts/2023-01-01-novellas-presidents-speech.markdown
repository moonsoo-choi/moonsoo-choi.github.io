A journalist asked the President a question. 

The President, deep in thought for a few seconds, replied, 
"...the climate change that we must fight for, in the action and the coalition that we must embrace and foster upon. We must unite in the name of the indivisible congregation of the crowd, under the divinity of the Constitution that we must uphold. Creation of jobs will be enabled by saving the environment, a protection of which upholds the utmost importance, and we will continue to exert the hard work and hold our actions to the highest level of accountability possible."

The panel moderator interjected in the middle of the president's speech, saying "...but Mr. President," continued the moderator, "...we just asked you what day of the week it was."
