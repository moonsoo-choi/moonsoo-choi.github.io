# Interests

Like many, I have a diverse array of interests in philosophy, business, and the intersection of the two. Like all, I only have 24 hours a day, so I am (and will be) eternally behind on my reading/thinking list.

But I jotted them down in hopes that, one day, I can enjoy a cup of joe ☕ with you to chat about these topics and learn from you.

## Philosophy
- Understanding more about:
  1. [Rawlsian framework of fairness and justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#JusFaiJusWitLibSoc)... I actually see an interesting link between [veil of ignorance](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/veil-of-ignorance) and [differences among SCOTUS justices' approaches to racism](https://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r33547.pdf)
  2. [Saint Thérèse of Lisieux](https://www.littleflower.org/st-therese/)
  3. Philosophy of labor
    * [Simone Weil](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simone-weil/)
    * [Russell Banks](https://www.russellbanks.com/)
  5. Existentialism (in particular, how existentialist thoughts evolve - or devolve - in organizations)
    * Franz Kafka (the most interesting yet perplexing quote: "...I believe we are not such a radical relapse of God's, only one of his bad moods. He had a bad day.")
    * Albert Camus 
    * Martin Heidegger

## Management
- Organizational dynamics (and why 1 + 1 is 2 when you ask an individual, but it isn't always 2 when you ask a group of humans)
- Bonanza in organizations

## Operations:
 - Experiment design & planning for supply chain and operations
 - Service management, behavioral operations (main theme for my PhD research)
 - Queueing (read Dave Maister's [Psychology of Waiting Lines](https://davidmaister.com/wp-content/themes/davidmaister/pdf/PsycholgyofWaitingLines751.pdf))
