# Philosophy
- Understanding more about:
  1. [Rawlsian framework of fairness and justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#JusFaiJusWitLibSoc)... I actually see an interesting link between [veil of ignorance](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/veil-of-ignorance) and [differences among SCOTUS justices' approaches to racism](https://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r33547.pdf)
  2. [Saint Thérèse of Lisieux](https://www.littleflower.org/st-therese/)
  3. Existentialism (in particular, how existentialist thoughts evolve - or devolve - in organizations)
  * Franz Kafka (the most interesting yet perplexing quote: "...I believe we are not such a radical relapse of God's, only one of his bad moods. He had a bad day.")
  * Albert Camus
  * Martin Heidegger
  4. Organizational dynamics (and why 1 + 1 is 2 when you ask an individual, but it isn't always 2 when you ask a group of humans)
  
# Operations:
 - Experiment design & planning for supply chain and operations
 - Service management, behavioral operations (main theme for my PhD research)
 - Queueing (read Dave Maister's [Psychology of Waiting Lines](https://davidmaister.com/wp-content/themes/davidmaister/pdf/PsycholgyofWaitingLines751.pdf))
