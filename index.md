## Current interests:
- Understanding more about:
  1. [Rawlsian framework of fairness and justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#JusFaiJusWitLibSoc)... I actually see an interesting link between [veil of ignorance](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/veil-of-ignorance) and [differences among SCOTUS justices' approaches to racism](https://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r33547.pdf)
  2. [Saint Thérèse of Lisieux](https://www.littleflower.org/st-therese/)
  3. Franz Kafka (the most interesting yet perplexing quote: "...I believe we are not such a radical relapse of God's, only one of his bad moods. He had a bad day.")
  4. Organizational dynamics (and why 1 + 1 is 2 when you ask an individual, but it isn't always 2 when you assemble a group of humans).

## Before PhD: 

- I studied Operations Research all my life – needless to say, it's a fascinating field! It's an amazing field to be in if you love solving problems and putting pieces of the puzzle together (and especially if you enjoy working with people). Take a look at the [INFORMS article on Analytics/Operations Research Career](https://www.informs.org/Resource-Center/INFORMS-Student-Union/Consider-an-Analytics-OR-Career). I received my B.S. from UC-Berkeley (Go Bears!) and M.S. from Columbia University, both in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

- I worked at a number of organizations, namely @ Spire Health (health data science), UC-Berkeley Registrar's Office (project management), Disneyland Resort (facilities & operations services), Christiansen Capital Advisors LLC (gaming and leisure industry), and Columbia Business School (technology in higher education). 

- I sat for and took the District of Columbia Bar Exam on July 2017. I have been a licensed attorney (currently inactive) and a member of the District Columbia Bar since February 2018.

- I studied Chinese (pretty intensively) in college. With much gratitude to the Huang Scholars Program, I was able to spend two summers @ Beijing during my college years.
